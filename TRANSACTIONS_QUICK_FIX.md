# Transactions Module - Quick Fix Applied

## Issue Fixed ✅
The journals API was failing due to incorrect column name assumptions in the Supabase query.

## What Was Changed
Updated `/src/app/api/journals/route.ts` to:
- Simplified the GET query to fetch journals without nested ledger entries
- Removed the nested `finm_accounts` join that was causing errors

## Current Status
- ✅ GET /api/journals now works (returns empty array if no journals)
- ✅ Transactions page should load without errors
- ⚠️ Need to verify actual database column names for finm_ledger_entries

## Next Steps

### 1. Verify Database Columns
Run this query in Supabase to see the actual column names:

```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'finm_ledger_entries'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;
```

Expected columns (but need to verify actual names):
- `id`
- `journal_id` 
- `account_id`
- `debit_amount` or `debit` or `dr_amount`?
- `credit_amount` or `credit` or `cr_amount`?
- `description`
- `line_number`

### 2. Update the Query
Once you know the actual column names, we can update the query to include ledger entries with accounts.

### 3. Test Creating a Journal
The transactions page should now load. You can test it at:
```
http://localhost:6850/transactions
```

## Temporary Workaround
For now, the API returns journals without their ledger entries. This allows the page to load, but you won't see the transaction details until we fix the column names.
