# Database Setup Instructions

## Issue Resolution
The application error "Failed to execute 'json' on 'Response': Unexpected token '<'" is caused by missing database tables in Supabase.

## Quick Fix Steps

### 1. Open Supabase Dashboard
- Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
- Select your project: `xnetjsifkhtbbpadwlxy.supabase.co`

### 2. Run Database Schema
- Click "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
- Copy the entire contents of `database/schema.sql`
- Paste and execute it

### 3. Add Sample Data
- Copy the entire contents of `database/sample-data.sql`
- Paste and execute it

### 4. Test the Application
After running the schema, test these endpoints:
- Health check: http://localhost:6850/api/health/database
- Books API: http://localhost:6850/api/books
- Organizations API: http://localhost:6850/api/organizations

## Environment Variables Fixed
✅ Fixed `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` environment variable
✅ Server is running on port 6850
✅ API endpoints are accessible

## What's Working Now
- Supabase connection established
- API routes responding (but need database tables)
- Environment variables correctly configured
- Application architecture properly set up

## Next Steps
Once the database schema is deployed, the application will work correctly and you can:
1. View the dashboard
2. Create accounting books
3. Manage accounts and transactions
4. Use all financial management features
