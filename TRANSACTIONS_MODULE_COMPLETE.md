# 📝 Transactions Module - Implementation Complete!

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (Already Existed)
- **finm_journals** table - Stores journal headers
- **finm_ledger_entries** table - Stores individual debit/credit lines
- Proper foreign key relationships and constraints

### 2. API Endpoints ✨ Updated to Supabase
**Location:** `/src/app/api/journals/route.ts`

#### GET /api/journals
**Purpose:** Fetch journal entries with filters

**Query Parameters:**
- `bookId` - Filter by book
- `status` - Filter by status (draft, posted, reversed)
- `startDate` - Filter from date
- `endDate` - Filter to date

**Response:** Array of journals with nested ledger entries and account details

**Example:**
```bash
curl 'http://localhost:6850/api/journals?bookId=<book-uuid>'
```

#### POST /api/journals
**Purpose:** Create a new journal entry

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "bookId": "uuid",
  "date": "2025-10-21",
  "description": "Opening balance",
  "reference": "OB-001",

      "debitAmount": 0,
      "creditAmount": 100000,
      "description": "Owner's capital"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Response:** Created journal with all entries and account details

### 3. UI Page (Already Exists)
**Location:** `/src/app/transactions/page.tsx`

**Features:**
- List all journals
- Create new journal entries
- View journal details
- Filter by book
- Show debits and credits

**Access:** `http://localhost:6850/transactions` (requires authentication)

## 🚀 How to Use Transactions

### Step 1: Create Accounts First
Before creating transactions, you need accounts. Go to:
```
http://localhost:6850/dashboard/accounts
```

Create at least 2 accounts, for example:
1. **Cash** (Asset account)
2. **Owner's Capital** (Equity account)

### Step 2: Create a Journal Entry

**Option A: Using the UI**
1. Go to `http://localhost:6850/transactions`
2. Click "New Journal Entry"
3. Fill in:
   - Date
   - Description
   - Add lines (Account, Debit, Credit)
4. Ensure Debits = Credits
5. Click "Save"

**Option B: Using the API**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:6850/api/journals \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "bookId": "your-book-uuid",
    "date": "2025-10-21",
    "description": "Opening balance entry",
    "reference": "OB-001",
    "entries": [
      {
        "accountId": "cash-account-uuid",
        "debitAmount": 100000,
        "creditAmount": 0,
        "description": "Opening cash balance"
      },
      {
        "accountId": "capital-account-uuid",
        "debitAmount": 0,
        "creditAmount": 100000,
        "description": "Owner investment"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

### Step 3: View Transactions
```bash
# Fetch all journals for a book
curl 'http://localhost:6850/api/journals?bookId=<book-uuid>' | jq '.'
```

## 🔍 Database Structure

### finm_journals Table
```sql
- id (UUID, PK)
- book_id (UUID, FK to finm_books)
- journal_number (VARCHAR) - e.g., "JV-0001"
- reference (VARCHAR) - Optional reference number
- date (DATE) - Transaction date
- description (TEXT) - Journal description
- status (VARCHAR) - draft, posted, reversed
- total_amount (DECIMAL) - Total debit/credit amount
- created_by (VARCHAR)
- posted_at (TIMESTAMP)
- created_at (TIMESTAMP)
- updated_at (TIMESTAMP)
```

### finm_ledger_entries Table
```sql
- id (UUID, PK)
- journal_id (UUID, FK to finm_journals)
- account_id (UUID, FK to finm_accounts)
- debit_amount (DECIMAL) - Debit amount
- credit_amount (DECIMAL) - Credit amount
- description (TEXT) - Line description
- line_number (INTEGER) - Order of lines
- created_at (TIMESTAMP)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Double-Entry Bookkeeping Rules
1. **Every transaction must have at least 2 entries**
2. **Total debits MUST equal total credits**
3. **An entry can have EITHER debit OR credit (never both)**
4. **All amounts must be positive** (use debit vs credit to show direction)

### Debit vs Credit Quick Reference

**Increase with Debit:**
- Assets (Cash, Bank, Accounts Receivable)
- Expenses (Rent, Salary, Utilities)

**Increase with Credit:**
- Liabilities (Accounts Payable, Loans)
- Equity (Capital, Retained Earnings)
- Revenue (Sales, Service Income)

### Journal Numbering
- Auto-generated in format: `JV-NNNN`
- Starts from `JV-0001`
- Increments per book

---

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Before Testing
- [ ] Book created
- [ ] At least 2 accounts created
- [ ] Server running on port 6850

### Test Cases
- [ ] Create simple 2-line journal (debit cash, credit capital)
- [ ] Try to create unbalanced entry (should fail)
- [ ] Try to create entry with only 1 line (should fail)
- [ ] Try to create entry with negative amount (should fail)
- [ ] Try to create entry with both debit and credit on same line (should fail)
- [ ] Fetch journals for a book
- [ ] View journal details with account names

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Integration with Other Modules
1. **Invoices** - Auto-create journal entries when invoicing
2. **Bills** - Auto-create journal entries when recording bills
3. **Payments** - Auto-create journal entries for payments
4. **Reports** - Use journal entries to generate financial reports

### Enhancements
1. **Draft Mode** - Save journals as draft before posting
2. **Journal Reversal** - Reverse posted journals
3. **Attachments** - Upload supporting documents
4. **Approval Workflow** - Multi-level approval for journals
5. **Audit Trail** - Track who created/modified journals
6. **Recurring Journals** - Auto-create monthly recurring entries
